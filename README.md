# cgn-java-23-2-teamproject-finance
This mobile application was developed as our team project during [Java Development Bootcamp at neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/en/bootcamp/java-development) in July 2023.

# Background
- The main topic was a "virtual animal shelter" which was divided into five team projects: ["animals"](https://github.com/neuefische/cgn-java-23-2-teamproject-animals), ["party planner"](https://github.com/neuefische/cgn-java-23-2-teamproject-partyplanner), ["themes"](https://github.com/neuefische/cgn-java-23-2-teamproject-themes), ["quiz"](https://github.com/neuefische/cgn-java-23-2-teamproject-quiz), and "finance planner".
- Each team project was developed separately and based on scrum with vertical sliced user stories.
- It was intended to be a review exercise in group as well as a preparation for individual capstone projects conducted in August 2023.
